# Guess the Note
This is a simple web application that generates a random note within a randomly selected key signature, and then presents three buttons, one with the correct note and two with incorrect notes. The goal of the game is to guess the correct note by clicking on the correct button.

The code is written in JavaScript and uses the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate the HTML. It defines a set of keys and their corresponding key signatures, as well as a pool of notes. It then generates a random key signature and a random note within that key signature, as well as two incorrect notes that are not in the selected key signature.

The code then shuffles the placement of the notes and adds them to the buttons in the HTML. It also adds event listeners to the buttons that check if the user has clicked on the correct note and provides feedback accordingly.

Finally, it adds a "New Game" button that, when clicked, reloads the page to start a new game.

The CSS styles are used to set the layout, colors, and fonts of the HTML elements.
